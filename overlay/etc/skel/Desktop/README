VoidBang Linux

We have created an iso that uses Void Linux as a base with its runit init system. Added many of the packages and features of ArchBang Linux (based on Archlinux)

Currently we have working#

Sound
Wired Net
Autologin
Dbus 
X

To set up wireless connection I suggest running the following for now

sudo void-installer

Select Network option and follow on screen instructions

We are not going to supply an installer for VoidBang void-installer is amazing and very easy to use.

We hope you enjoy VoidBang and it inspires you to install Void Linux
